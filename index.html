          <p>Paris is a multinational and multicultural city, vibrant and lively. It has its own special atmosphere. Couples in love picnicking in the parks, elegant ladies with dogs, the smell of fresh croissants, avant-garde exhibitions and the sunset over the Seine... This is one of the cities that should be savored slowly, without rushing.</p>

          <p><strong>The Eiffel Tower</strong> is a constant symbol of the city. The structure, which is about 300 meters high, has three observation decks, the highest of which is 274 meters high. Before sunset, it offers a magnificent view of the city. There is a fountain and parks for walking on both sides of the tower. In the evening, Parisian youth gather here to admire its evening lights.</p>

		  <p><strong>The Arc de Triomphe</strong> is built on Charles de Gaulle Square. From it, 12 avenues diverge in different directions, the most famous of which is the Champs Elysees. The arch itself is central to the Golden Axis or the Axis of Triumph, which is a series of avenues, architectural and historical monuments that are lined up in a single line. The Golden Axis begins near the Louvre and ends with the Grand Arch in the modern-day district of Defiance.</p>
